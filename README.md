# Time series forecasting
This is the repository for the practice work of Brandon Janes for the class "Time series analysis," a graduate course at FaMAF's #DiploDatos National University of CÃ³rdoba.

Based in "A short course on forecasting" by Marcel Scharth, The University of Sydney.

This material draws on the Forecasting Principles and Practice textbook by Rob Hyndman and George Athanasopoulos. While the textbook and Rob Hyndman's DataCamp course use R, our tutorials provide a Python version of related content, but based only in statsmodels and the scipy stack.

This version: September 6, 2019.

* Tutorials (Python)
* Working with time stamped data in Python
